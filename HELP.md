# Rich Domain Objects (RDO)

Rich Domain Objects (RDO) is a design pattern in software development that focuses on encapsulating business logic within domain objects rather than relying heavily on anemic data models (which only contain data without behavior). Hereâ€™s a summary of the key principles and benefits of using Rich Domain Objects, along with an explanation of the provided code example:

## Key Principles of Rich Domain Objects

1. **Encapsulation of Business Logic**:
    - RDOs contain both data and behavior, meaning they can perform operations relevant to the data they hold. This helps to keep the logic closer to the data, making the system easier to understand and maintain.

2. **Consistency**:
    - By having business rules encapsulated in the objects themselves, the risk of inconsistent states is reduced. For example, validation logic (like ensuring an age is positive or that a category corresponds to the age) is contained within the object.

3. **Self-Validation**:
    - Objects can validate their state before allowing operations. In the provided code, the Athlete class validates age and category when created, enforcing rules right at the point of data creation.

4. **Rich Interfaces**:
    - RDOs often provide a richer set of methods for interaction, allowing for more expressive operations that can manipulate the state of the object in meaningful ways.

5. **Behavior-Driven Design**:
    - The focus on behavior encourages developers to think in terms of actions and interactions within the domain, leading to better design that aligns with business needs.

## Explanation of the Provided Code

### Athlete Class:
- Represents an athlete with attributes name, age, and category.
- The constructor initializes these attributes and sets the category based on age.
- The static create method is a factory method that encapsulates object creation.
- It includes methods to access the athlete's name, age, and category, as well as a method to change the category if the athlete's age changes.
- The methods setAge and setCategory enforce rules and encapsulate the logic for maintaining valid states.

### Category Enum:
- Defines different categories (ELITE, JUNIOR, MASTER) based on age ranges.
- Each category has minimum and maximum age attributes, allowing the Athlete class to determine the appropriate category based on an athlete's age.

## Benefits of Rich Domain Objects

1. **Improved Readability**: Code becomes more intuitive as it closely aligns with business logic.
2. **Easier Maintenance**: Changes in business rules can often be made within the domain objects, reducing the risk of side effects in other parts of the application.
3. **Testability**: RDOs can be easily unit tested, as they encapsulate both state and behavior.

Overall, Rich Domain Objects are a powerful approach to designing software that accurately models complex business logic while maintaining clarity and maintainability.
